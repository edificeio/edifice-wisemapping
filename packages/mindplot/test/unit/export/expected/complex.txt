2 Strategy 2: Talent Development
  [Note: Strategy #2: Support the talent development of our employees through professional development and learning and through improved performance management.]
	2.1 Strategic Priority 2a: Personal Plans
	  [Note: Each employee will have a personal Professional Development Plan.  ]
	2.2 Strategic Priority 2b: External learning matches organ. goals
	  [Note: Each department of Freeform will identify areas that need development to meet overall FS goals.  Eg.  Project Manager may identify needed improvement in a development tool.  Or... Bus. Dev. may identify a new need in NFP that FS could fill within mandate, if training were provided.  Professional Dev. priority will be given to proposals for development with clear ROIs.]
	2.3 Strategic Priority 2c: Learning Environment
	  [Note: Learning and innovation are an essential part of providing the best solutions to NFPs.  Cost effective internal learning and time to explore innovation will be encouraged, provided they conform with organization goal and clear ROI is demonstrated.]
	2.4 üåà So That...
	  [Note: (So that... our employees have improved skills and knowledge, So that... they are highly competent and can work well in agile teams and feel fulfilled and self actualized... So that we can so the best work possible, for the least cost, in the shortest time for other NFPs, So that... NFPs can help those who need it.)]
3 Strategy 4: Inclusive, Positive Environment
  [Note: Strategy #4: Foster a diverse, inclusive community with a positive work environment.]
	3.1 Strategic Priority 4a:Feedback
	  [Note: Conduct regular organizational feedback assessments and collaborate to improve the work climate]
	3.2 Strategic Priority 4b: Anti Harassment

	  [Note: (So that... we can reflect the diverse populations we serve AND ensure everyone feels safe, respected  and  included, So that... we better serve our diverse client organizations AND we are a great place to work )]
4 Strategy 1: Recruit & Retain
  [Note: Recruit and retain top talent commensurate with identified organizational capacity requirements ]
	4.1 So that...
	  [Note: (So that... we find and keep good people, So that... they are highly competent and can work well in agile teams... So that we can so the best work possible, for the least cost, in the shortest time for other NFPs, So that... NFPs can help those who need it.)]
	4.2 Strategic Priority 1a: Recruitment
	  [Note: 1. Identify and use proactive and effective recruitment strategies, ]
		4.2.1 Modify App Form
		  [Note: Recently, I saw a few job posts sent through different community
groups and they seem to be taking our idea of screening candidates
to a next level. Not only they ask candidates to provide resume and
cover letter + some project related information but also request
written answers to questions like "Why are you interested in this
position" etc. That allows to screen out people who just submit
multiple resumes to multiple organizations without really applying
for that particular job and it would make our interview process more
straightforward, knowing answers to some questions.

For example, we may want to always include in the screening
questions:
- Why do you want to work for Freeform Solutions?
- Why are you interested in this position?
- What's your experience working with NFP?
- What's your experience working with Open Source software?
etc.

I also saw that people ask for references up front, in that
submissions form. We could include the HR requirement that Heather
brought recently for "permissions to ask your references about you"
in the online form so that we don't have to follow up with this
later.

Attached below a sample of such screening questions]
		4.2.2 Strategy integrated with hiring plan
		  [Note: Hiring plan should be comprehensive... not Agile or Iterative, in the sense that staff capacity and skill needs should be met within at least a six month plan.  If three Drupal developers are needed, the hiring should be done concurrently to minimize HR costs and time.]
	4.3 Strategic Priority 1b: Hiring
	  [Note: 2. Continue to practice our unique Freeform hiring process that balances fit with the Freeform culture and best talent ]
	4.4 Strategic Priority 1c: Onboarding
	  [Note:  ]
		4.4.1 3 Month Onboarding Process
		4.4.2 Tools & Guidelines
		4.4.3 Mentoring
	4.5 Strategic Priority 1d: Incentives
	  [Note: 5. Explore incentives - monetary, benefits, fulfilment - needed to encourage top talent to work for and remain working for an NFP]
		4.5.1 Raises
		4.5.2 Benefits
		4.5.3 Rewards Message
		  [Note: Create a total rewards message to encourage prospective and current employees to understand the full value of working for Freeform]
	4.6 Strategic Priority 1e: Offboarding
	  [Note: Assess and address reasons why talented people leave Freeform]
